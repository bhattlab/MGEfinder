# *mustache* - Tool box to identify mobile element insertions from short-read sequencing data

The command-line tool *mustache* identifies large insertions and genotypes from short-read sequencing data.

It is designed to work with haploid genomes, and has been tested extensively on bacteria.

It can identify mobile genetic elements and their sites of insertion using a *de novo* approach.
